RobotFramework-Random
=====================
This repository details a collection of **random utilities that can be used within tests written using RobotFramework** that aren't found in the default libraries. We wrote a bunch of custom keywords to fit the needs of our project and realized later on that this would be incredibly useful to others too.

This, however, is a work in progress. We intend to create pull requests and push specific keywords from this library to any other applicable library when the need arises.

Installation and Usage
======================
```pip install robotframework-randomlibrary```

For individual keyword documentation, please see http://svyzz.github.io/robotframework-random
